# vlz-scraper
Super simple and basic python script that scrapes VectorLogoZone for all of its contributed logos and downloads them to a folder. It also gives you a little report at the end of what was done :)

## Getting Started
Just download Python3 from your preferred source, install the necessary packages (`selenium` & `requests`) and run the `main.py` script!


## Attributions
Please go check out [VectorLogoZone](https://www.vectorlogo.zone/), it's an awesome project :)
